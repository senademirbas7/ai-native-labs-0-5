# AI-Native Engineering: Lab & Architecture Portfolio

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of AI-assisted software engineering practices, artifacts, and documentation completed during the **EPAM AI Engineering Bootcamp**. 

It demonstrates the shift from traditional "vibe coding" to **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **Context Engineering**.

## 📌 Repository Contents

This project is divided into three core knowledge areas:

### 1. Memory Banks (Context Engineering)
Structured contextual memory designed for AI consumption to maintain project architecture, domain rules, and coding standards across sessions.
* `memory-banks/architecture/overview.md` - System design and tech stack (React 18, Vite, TypeScript).
* `memory-banks/conventions/coding-standards.md` - Naming, testing, and file structure rules.
* `memory-banks/domain/glossary.md` - Project-specific terminology.

### 2. Spec-Driven Development (SpecKit)
Artifacts generated using the GitHub SpecKit framework, showcasing a deterministic pipeline from requirements to implementation.
* `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Immutable governance layer.
* `specs/templates/` - AI-generated templates for PRDs, Epics, and Stories.
* `specs/prds/` & `specs/stories/` - Executable specification documents.

### 3. MCP Tool Integrations & Lab Guides
Documentation and guides for Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations:
* **Context7:** Up-to-date library documentation retrieval.
* **Playwright:** Natural language browser automation.
* **Atlassian (Jira/Confluence):** Two-way synchronization of specs to Jira issues and Confluence pages.
* `.github/prompts/` - Reusable prompt library for batch operations and sync status checks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4
* **AI Tools:** GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, SpecKit CLI
* **Methodologies:** Spec-Driven Development (SDD), TDD, LocalStorage Persistence

## 🚀 Getting Started
To view the AI integration prompts, check the `.github/prompts/` directory. To understand the architectural constraints applied to the AI, read the `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
