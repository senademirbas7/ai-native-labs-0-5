# Memory Banks - [Your Project Name]

## Purpose
This memory bank provides persistent context for AI assistants working on
[your project]. It contains architectural decisions, coding conventions,
domain knowledge, and workflows that should guide all AI-generated code.

## Structure

### architecture/
System architecture, technology stack, deployment approach, and key
architectural decisions.

### conventions/
Coding standards, naming conventions, testing patterns, error handling,
and quality criteria.

### domain/
Domain-specific terminology, business rules, user personas, and key
concepts unique to this project.

### workflows/
Development processes, code review procedures, deployment workflows,
and team collaboration patterns.

### roles/
Role-specific context for different team members (developers, QA engineers,
product managers).

## How to Use
When asking AI to generate code or documentation for this project, reference
the relevant memory bank files to provide context. Most AI assistants can
load these files automatically from the project directory.

## Maintenance
Review and update quarterly or when major architectural/process changes occur.
Version control these files alongside project code.
